Python's standard library has a built-in property() function. 
It returns a property object. It acts as an interface to the instance variables of a
 Python class.

The encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming requires that the instance 
variables should have a restricted private access. Python doesn't have efficient mechanism 
for the purpose. The property() function provides an alternative.

The property() function uses the getter, setter and delete methods defined in a class to 
define a property object for the class.
